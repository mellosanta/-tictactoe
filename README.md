  MECHANICS 

Tic-tac-toe is a simple game usually played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to get three of your own symbols (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Here are the rules or mechanics of the game: 

Players: Two players participate in the game. One player uses X, and the other uses O. 

Grid: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, which has 9 cells. 

Turns: Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty cell on the grid. 

Winning: The game is won by the first player to align three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). 

RULES 

Starting the Game: 

Decide who goes first. This can be done randomly or by mutual agreement. 

The player who goes first places an X, and the other player uses O. 

Taking Turns: 

Players alternate turns. 

On a playerâ€™s turn, they choose an empty cell to place their symbol (X or O). 

Winning the Game: 

A player wins if they manage to place three of their symbols in a row. This row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. 

Game End: 

Win: The game ends as soon as a player achieves three symbols in a row. 

Draw: If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw. 

Invalid Moves: Players must place their symbol in an empty cell. If a cell is already occupied, the move is invalid and must be replayed. 

Resetting: 

After a win or a draw, the game can be restarted with an empty grid for a new round.
